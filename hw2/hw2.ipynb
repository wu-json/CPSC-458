    "### Income Portfolio\n",
    "For our income portfolio, we are interested two major properties: stability and yield. We want this to be something we can live off of without much effort in maintaining the portfolio itself (passive income). To accomplish this, we will employ the following strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HOLD all assets in this portolio:** We should choose ssets that we never have to sell as one of our major criteria is low maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prioritize assets with high dividend yield:** This is fairly straightforward, as we want to earn as much income via dividends per dollar invested. We don't want to overly prioritize this though, as we want to make sure the asset is healthy (recall criteria number 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prioritize assets with lower volatility:** For our portfolio to be a consistent income earner, we need to make sure the company is healthy and not too volatile so that we can expect a relatively reliable stream of income each quarter. If our portfolio dies one quarter, then we don't eat that quarter...\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prioritize large cap assets:** Large cap assets are relatively stable most of the time. While nothing is immune to fluctuating prices (especially in the current political/economic climate), it's harder to push over giants than ants.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prioritize stocks with positive net income:** This typically implies a company is stable and has their finances together, as it allows a company to pay off debt, invest in equipment/materials, and make other investments."
